# EasyANN

This is an Easiest and most Detailed example of Artificial Neural Network written in C.

Why this Easiest?

No Complex Math Formula.

No complex library depends, only <stdio.h> and <stdlib.h>.

Easy to compile, wether you are using Linux/Mac/Windows at almost ANY version.

How this Detailed?

This code will show you the whole ANN training mechanism, within about only 200 lines of C code!

If you are the one who want to see the things really work like us, this code best for you.

So this example code is very suitable for Education.

# How to build

On Linux/macOS

```bash
gcc main.c -o main
```
On Windows

Drag main.c into Dev C++ or Visual Studio(Sure need to create a Win32 C++ console project) then click 'Compile' or 'Build'

# Q&A

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue!

You may noticed the backward2() Function, well that's another style of writing, work same as backward().

Comments is going on to add.

If you run directly, you are expected to see the neural network training to fit the target data.
